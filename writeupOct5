Gabe write-up for Oct 5

Over the last couple weeks, I've been working with Jacob and Max on the optimization side of things. We've already made substantial progress in improving code efficiency and speed. Specifically:
- I profiled the code and identified several computationally-intensive segments in the code
- Some of these segments were easily optimizable and were reworked for a significant speedup (e.g. function eccentricity in mccSearch.py)
- Certain operations were vectorizeable in numpy (computations which occurred in a loop could be brought out of the loop and expressed as vector operations, which generally speeds things up significantly, since numpy is quite fast).This led to additional speedup
- I experimented with a basic parallelization strategy - splitting up the image processing by frame over several worker threads - which gave another significant speedup. This involved refactoring some of the work done in find_Cloud_Elements in mccSearch.py into subroutines which handled image processing (which can be done in parallel) and graph building (which could be done in parallel or nearly so, but seems to be relatively fasts). 
- I'm beginning to examine code for further refactoring, which will make code easier to profile, easier to test, and easier to speedup further.
