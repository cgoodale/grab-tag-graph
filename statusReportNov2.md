Gabe Mel: Status report for Nov 2

The past week, since our last deliverable, I've worked on a couple things:

- Dealing with various minor code issues that @kwhitehall brought up:
    + Moved imports and initializations into their proper places according to the code standards
    + Gave user control over image processing parallelism. Moved the number of workers into a global which can be changed.
    + Attempted to move a helper class into utils.py but ran into problems with circualr imports. I'm still thinking about a solution.
    + Still on the stack is to rename the parallel par_find_cloud_elements() function to the original name, find_cloud_elements(), so that the API doesn't change. I thought I'd wait to do this until the parallel version has been tested and shown to have the same results.
- Testing the code to make sure the results are the same as the originals
    + So far, I've had trouble replicating a bug that @kwhitehall pointed out. Specifically, I've done the following:
        * Run baselineTiming.py with old code, dumped in OLD
        * Run baselineTiming.py with new code, dumped in NEW
        * Changed pathnames in checkMERGBaseline.py to point to NEW and OLD code-run results
        * ran checkMERGBaseline.py
        * opened the diffLog.txt file that is generated
    + When I examined the diffLog, I found no differences. I tried this with two intermediate new versions of the code: the vectorized, serial version; and the vectorized and parellel version. 
    + I added a print and write statements in the new and old baselineTiming.py to look at the graph nodes generated by the two different versions. The two unittestResults files have identical nodes lists. I'm still working with @kwhitehall to replicate the bug. 
    + If we can replicate the bug, I have a lead on where to start looking. If we can't replicate it, and we end up confident that the parallel, vectorized version is running correctly, we can work on further code improvements. 
- Pushing up a simple diagram showing the flow of execution in the new parallel version. Should be up tonight (Nov 2) (UPDATE: pushed as pdf "Parallel_version_flow.pdf" in grab-tag-graph directory. Also at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d2n4nZoGPsKtD_J971k2v6p1LjvnrDsSpm9mMXPd4sQ/edit?usp=sharing).
